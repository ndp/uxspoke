== Welcome to UX/Spoke

The UX/Spoke tool is designed to help you explore many of the different
usability tools out there. It is designed to force you to approach it
in a certain way-- what questions am I asking now-- and spur you to
consider other tools that you may not be using.

This product was provoked by working with people and teams that found
one tool and hammered it to death--
  "How do we add metrics to this?",
  "What do our metrics tell us to do next?"
  "Let's do usability testing every week."
  "Let's make sure we're talking to our users every week."

Although none of those are necessarily bad ideas, it's worth stepping back
to get the big picture.

== Technical

It's all Javascript, using Canvas for the wheel. I'm not sure I mean to
make a spinning wheel, but I stumbled across one, built a simple version
quickly, and then got committed to that metaphor. I think there are probably
other interfaces that would be more intuitive, but what the heck-- is it
usable enough?

I use Csster (http://github.com/ndp/csster) and jQuery (http://jQuery.com).
I don't use jQueryUI (except for a single easing function, which-- to be honest--
would be good to factor away).

This project fits into my investigation into "micro-apps": What can I build
in just a few hours that is useful in its own right?

Comments, thoughts always welcome,
Andy
